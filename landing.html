                <p class="mainA">This is a coding portfolio page. Periodically I will be expanding the content and apps. </p>
                <p class='mainA'>It is not really about Garnets; though there is a link above leading to some information and pictures.</p>
                <p> I was a born rock hound and have a BS in Geology and think Garnets are cool.</p>
                <p class='mainA'>As for the red Zia logo: It on a yellow background is New Mexico's state flag/logo. A few years ago while I was living there, the state put the Zia with a similiar blue background on some of their licence plates and it really grabbed me.
                    I also earned my degrees from New Mexico State University. The exposed geology and a chance to see history in the rocks is facinating. While doing some field work, I had the opportunity to come across rocks dated back over a billion
                    years old that are now exposed. New Mexico is an amazing land with a wide variety of climates and landscapes. My family settled in the area in 1880's, so growing up I got to hear a lot of great history.</p>
