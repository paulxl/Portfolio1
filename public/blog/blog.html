                <p>So I got around to playing with <a href='https://threejs.org/'>three.js</a> yesterday and have to say it was a little addicting; kind of like playing Tetris.  It can be fun.  Then I had to ask myself 'How much time do I want to spend on this?' I can see the benifits of adding it to a companies logo or doing some little eye-catching trick to keep the visitor on a webpage entertained long enough to stick around. Not sure if I see much on the business side of it at the present time. 
                </p>
                <p>But hey it was fun, and I'll probably play with it again after hours.  </p>
                <p>Another 3-D renderer worth looking into is <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">babylon.js</a>  Though it looks more for creaters of games than web developers.</p>

                <p>&#128580;  Today I had a 'Doh!' moment looking back at code on this site.  Must have missed that little blurb in MDN web docs that said when you use getMonth() January gives 0.  Who would have thought they would present it in array format upon return?</p>
                <p>On my Extras page I mention an app I use frequently called 'SnippetsLab'.  I really wish I had found it when I started coding.  Oh how helpful it would have been.  I find it to be one of the handiest little apps that is not commonly mentioned and use it more and more each week.  So if you're reading this and you code; check it out <a href="https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/">HERE</a> or get it from the Apple App Store.</p>

                <p>
                    So yesteday I was looking around <a href='https://data.world'>data.world</a> for some ideas; which later lead me to <a href='https://www.census.gov/en.html'>The U.S. Census Bureau page</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is where I stumbled upon data for e-commerce. They have data from 1999 to present about how much of our commerce is e-commerce. And it got me wondering at what point will the percent level out?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So sometimes the best way to see data is to visualize it.  So let us graph it and see if we can get some insights.
                </p>
                <div class='container'>
                    <canvas id="eCommerce1"></canvas>
                </div>
                <p>We get a trendline (not shown) with the formula:</p>
                <p> y=0.0013x<sup>2</sup> + 0.342x + 1.5047</p>
                <P>and a R<sup>2</sup> value = 0.9958</P>
                <p>
                    This clearly indicates on-line purchases as a percent of total purchases are growing.  With our current Covid-19 situation; this is likely to climb even higher in the following quarters as numbers get reported to the US Census Bureau.
                </p>

                Well lets kick this off...  I have always been hesitant to write or express my opinions and ramblings in a public format.  I mean who cares unless you truly have something profound to say &#129300; 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well now I have this website and hey it's a play thing. I play a lot in sandboxes and I kick little ideas around all the time.  So... why not use a blog format to encourage me to share snippets of ideas that are not full blown apps or earth shattering ideas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plus it has the benefit of forcing me to remember to push to GitHub more often.  So here goes nothing.
