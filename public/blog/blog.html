                <p>Wow! has it been a while.  Got a real JOB as a software developer. It feels GOOD!  Took a Java refresher course, so this site took a temp vacation.  Started using IntellJ and found it so much easier to work with than Eclipse.  My real passion is still the front-end, so I hope to start digging into more libraries and push up more to this site; time permitting. </p>

                <p>Today it hit me.. I may not be actively employed as a coder/developer at the present moment; but I am a front-end developer.  How did this hit me?  Well I saw an article on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> introducing an article written on someone's personal web page.  What I realized I have been doing recently after going to such sites is view their layouts; colors, icons, ease of transition, etc. Oh, and especially any uniqueness factor I find. I also, and this is key; hit the F12 key, enter developer mode, and view the pages responsiveness. </p>
                <p>I mean who else but a front-end dev immediately wants to look under the hood of someone's personal webpage?  Or thinks 'that is so cool, look what they did that grabs the viewers attention'?  Clean look, eye catching graphics, not too busy, etc.  </p>
                <p>It makes me think about how I might do things differently on the 2.0 version of this site in the future.  Do I keep this around after landing a job for posterity? And create a new and improved page.  Or do I just start from scratch and implement all new features.  Time will only tell.</p>
                <p>One thing is for sure the next version will be using <img src="https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2019-07/horizontal-logo-monochromatic-white.png" alt="Docker Icon" width="auto" height="50px"> and maybe even Kubernetes.</p>
                <p>The back-end is all good and fine.  But the front-end is where you really get to play around and tinker.  </p>

                <p>So I got around to playing with <a href='https://threejs.org/'>three.js</a> yesterday and have to say it was a little addicting; kind of like playing Tetris.  It can be fun.  Then I had to ask myself 'How much time do I want to spend on this?' I can see the benifits of adding it to a companies logo or doing some little eye-catching trick to keep the visitor on a webpage entertained long enough to stick around. Not sure if I see much on the business side of it at the present time. 
                </p>
                <p>But hey it was fun, and I'll probably play with it again after hours.  </p>
                <p>Another 3-D renderer worth looking into is <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">babylon.js</a>  Though it looks more for creaters of games than web developers.</p>

                <p>&#128580;  Today I had a 'Doh!' moment looking back at code on this site.  Must have missed that little blurb in MDN web docs that said when you use getMonth() January gives 0.  Who would have thought they would present it in array format upon return?</p>
                <p>On my Extras page I mention an app I use frequently called 'SnippetsLab'.  I really wish I had found it when I started coding.  Oh how helpful it would have been.  I find it to be one of the handiest little apps that is not commonly mentioned and use it more and more each week.  So if you're reading this and you code; check it out <a href="https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/">HERE</a> or get it from the Apple App Store.</p>

                <p>
                    So yesteday I was looking around <a href='https://data.world'>data.world</a> for some ideas; which later lead me to <a href='https://www.census.gov/en.html'>The U.S. Census Bureau page</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is where I stumbled upon data for e-commerce. They have data from 1999 to present about how much of our commerce is e-commerce. And it got me wondering at what point will the percent level out?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So sometimes the best way to see data is to visualize it.  So let us graph it and see if we can get some insights.
                </p>
                <div class='container'>
                    <canvas id="eCommerce1"></canvas>
                </div>
                <p>We get a trendline (not shown) with the formula:</p>
                <p> y=0.0013x<sup>2</sup> + 0.342x + 1.5047</p>
                <P>and a R<sup>2</sup> value = 0.9958</P>
                <p>
                    This clearly indicates on-line purchases as a percent of total purchases are growing.  With our current Covid-19 situation; this is likely to climb even higher in the following quarters as numbers get reported to the US Census Bureau.
                </p>

                Well lets kick this off...  I have always been hesitant to write or express my opinions and ramblings in a public format.  I mean who cares unless you truly have something profound to say &#129300; 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well now I have this website and hey it's a play thing. I play a lot in sandboxes and I kick little ideas around all the time.  So... why not use a blog format to encourage me to share snippets of ideas that are not full blown apps or earth shattering ideas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plus it has the benefit of forcing me to remember to push to GitHub more often.  So here goes nothing.
