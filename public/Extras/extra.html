            <h1>A Little Extra About Coding</h1>
            <h2>Where Do We Begin?</h2>
            <p>With so many options available to coders today, it can be a bit overwhelming deciding what tools to use.</p>
            <p>We have to balance out the learning curve time, what new features are being introduced, and the 'is it worth the trouble' dilemma. We also have to balance out the 'oh it is so cool to do this' with the 'will anyone except other coders care?'.
                Then we get the maintainability factor... Not to mention cost &#128580;</p>
            <p>Luckily there are some tried and tested methods/libraries/resouces available to us. Un-luckily everyone has a different opinion. Then there is cost! Unless some company is paying, we have to ask ourselves is it worth learning a new process
                and paying for it just to show we can use it. </p>
            <p>Documentation is still key. Many library custodians are doing a great job showcasing docs and examples. The good news is more people are writing how-tos and about their experiences and expanding upon the docs. </p>
            <p>When I went through my coding bootcamp; we joked about paying so much to learn how to Google for help &#129488; But truthfully it has became a mainstay in my daily routine. Finding and using resources can not be stated strongly enough. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>So What Tools Do I Use routinely?</h2>
            <p><b>Visual Studio Code:</b> After I started using it, all the other text editors seemed 'clunky'. Plus you have to love many of the extensions that just make our lives easier. And every coder has their favorite VS Code extensions and hacks.
                Formatted Snippets are so nice. You can drop a lengthy function into your code with just a tiny hint and hitting the return. </p>
            <p><b>Spring Tool Suite4:</b> Hey Java is a beast onto its own. Eclipse is the base but once you start using REST and more advanced features you gotta have more features. Plus this editor is free, verses the other primary java editor.</p>
            <p><b>Postman:</b> So easy to use to verify APIs. Great access point to see what end things are breaking. </p>
            <p><b>MySQL Workbench: </b>Yes you can do the same in a terminal window, but this gives some extra handy tools and database views.</p>
            <p><b>Medium:</b> Lots of great short articles. Bad news is you can spend a lot of time if you're not careful. Here is the link: <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium.com</a></p>
            <p><b>MDN Web Docks:</b> Because we can't be expected to remember everything. Great Source of information. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a></p>
            <p><b>You-Tube:</b> It used to be just misc. junk back in the beginning. But now you can find some real gems if you look around a bit and don't get lost. It will take some looking and time to find good content, but it's out there. The best videos
                seem to be the short ones that introduce particular features in areas like CSS or give a good overview of a library. </p>
            <p><b>Homebrew:</b> Allows updating packages so much more easily.</p>
            <p><b>Firefox Developer Edition:</b> I used to use Chrome but FF Dev just seems easier to get into the guts of a page. Whether I am working on one of my apps or I am trying to figure out how someone else did something, this is easier and more
                robust in my opinion.</p>
            <p><b>SnippetsLab.app</b> A recent addition to my arsenal. Lots of features and makes keeping track of snippets so much nicer than trying to remember which file in my sandbox I did some trick or task I forgot. <a href="https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/">Link Here</a></p>
            <p><b>GitHub: </b>It's not just for team collaboration. Now with extensions for VS Code, it is even easier &#128578; Plus it allows you to take risks and try things, if it blows-up, just role it back to a working model. &#128526;</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Final Words</h2>
            <p>You have to find a way to store references and links to hacks. Coding has forced me to better organize my thinking and to find better ways compartmentalize resources. As a Mac user, I use Safari browser for non-work related browsing. This
                allows my Firefox Dev browser to be designated for work, and I can organize sites based on languages or specifics of coding. My documents folder has no code. I created a simple folder called 'coding' with subfolders with good descriptors
                and put it in the top of favorites. </p>
            <p><b><u>Go Play In A Sandbox.</u></b> The best way I have found to explore a new concept in coding is just to create a sandbox and start coding. Reading code and seeing someone elses work is fine but I never really learn it or have it impregnated
                in my mind until I get the tactile experience. In addition new features come out all the time and a lot of examples I find don't quiet work as advertised. So you gotta play with it and make it yours to better understand its workings.</p>
